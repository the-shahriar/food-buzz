        <h2 class="blog-heading">Our Blog</h2>
        <p class="blog-description">Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in cooking with those of blog writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of them focus specifically on food photography.</p>

       <div class="blog-box">

                <a href="#"><h2>Blog 1</h2></a>
                <p>Want to start a food blog but don’t know where to start? I know how frustrating it can be to deal with technical stuff when you really just want to share that killer recipe. Whether you want to start a cooking blog, or you want to become a more successful food blogger, I hope these tips will ease your technical troubles.</p>

                <a href="#"><h2>Blog 2</h2></a>
                <p>Here are the basic steps to set up a self-hosted WordPress food blog that is both beautiful and functional. Your blog will have your own domain name and your own distinct look, and it will be able to scale with you as your blog grows. When you’re starting a food blog, I recommend following these steps for a greater shot at success.</p>

                <a href="#"><img src="images/food/Project Cover.png" alt="blog-image"></a>
                <a href="#"><h2>Blog 3</h2></a>
                <p>Coming up with a name for your new blog might be the hardest step. You can start brainstorming by coming up with a short mission statement or by listing words that describe your cooking style, your lifestyle, your background, etc. Throw in your name and/or your dog’s name. Talk it out with friends. There are tons of great names out there that aren’t yet taken, I promise!</p>
